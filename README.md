# Hideous Destructor Bestiary Expansion: Victimized Scientists

Author: Sirus

## Enemies:

Scientists: One of the more cruel shock tactics the Tyrant often enforces is what some would consider to be "Hellwaves", massive blasts of lost souls that sweep through a place before the main assault forces even arrive, corrupting and twisting those therein to a high degree.  While they get the most use out of the security forces and unwitting military, civilian workforces such as scientists, doctors or just maintenance staff also become unwitting pawns.  More than a few squads have suffered casualties at the hands of former colleagues, friends and family who suddenly decided it was time to serve a higher power and commit butchery with whatever they could get their hands on.  Unarmored and weak, soft targets, they are still quite capable of dealing a great deal of damage to those caught unawares or overwhelmed.

Tips: The dangerous ones are the ones with the hammer, the axe and the syringe.  Especially the syringe, since they are silent except for their death rattle.
